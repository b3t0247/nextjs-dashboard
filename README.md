# Next.js Foundations Course - Completed 🚀

This repository contains my completed project from the **Next.js Foundations Course**, where I built a full-stack financial dashboard application using **Next.js**.

## 📖 About the Project

Throughout this course, I learned the essential features of **Next.js**, including styling, optimizations, authentication, data fetching, and more. The project is a financial dashboard with:

- A **public home page**
- A **login page**
- **Dashboard pages** protected by authentication
- The ability to **add, edit, and delete invoices**
- An accompanying **Postgres database setup**

By the end of the course, I successfully built a functional full-stack application while deepening my understanding of **Next.js best practices**.
